\opening{Dear Dr Renaud}  % eg. Hello
Thank you for forwarding the kind comments of the referees towards my recently submitted manuscript (\#RG5158). I note that they were universally positive, with only minor adjustments to be made. These adjustments towards each referees comments are listed below, and I trust that they meet the requirements for publication in the \emph{Journal of Applied Crystallography}.


\textbf{referee 1}


\textbf{referee 2}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Resolve the question marks in the Sivia and Skilling reference} These references are completed successfully in our rendering of the latex document. I am unsure why they are not rendered properly by the submission gateway.
\item \textbf{In middle of page, Replace "user user" with "user"} This change is made.
\item \textbf{Third-to-last line â€“ shouldn't this read as p(&thetav;|D,I) instead of p(&thetav;|I,D)?} The order of D, I does not really matter, but we have changed it anyway to be consistent with equation 1.
\end{itemize}


\textbf{referee 3}
No amendments are required.


\textbf{referee 4}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Missing references in 1-Introduction (after Sivia 2006)?} These references are completed successfully in our rendering of the latex document. I am unsure why they are not rendered properly by the submission gateway.
